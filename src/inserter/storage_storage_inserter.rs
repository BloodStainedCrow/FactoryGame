// This issue is less important then BeltStorage since these inserters are less common
// TODO: This is the main issue to be solved.
//       The current implementation is very likely to have VERY poor cache utilization since it might load a whole
//       cache line, just to increase/decrease the value in a storage by one.
//       This problem could be somewhat reduces by just having stack inserters (since they write less often), but ensuring successive accesses
//       hit the same cache line is EXTREMELY important.
//       Luckily since inserter only have limited range (3 tiles or whatever) there is inherent locality in the accesses, if the MultiStores are somewhat spacially aligned.
//       Though this could also lead to particularly poor access patterns if the belt/line of inserters is perpendicular to the stride pattern of the Multistore
//       (maybe some weird quadtree weirdness could help?)
