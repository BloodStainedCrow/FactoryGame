// TODO: The current problem is that writing power usage to a slice will stop any vectorizations I might want to do
//       - A possible solution is chucking each MultiStore in it's connected power grid. That would complicate the inserter logic even more, though
//       - Another option is to limit the game to only ONE power grid (everything must be connected to the ship or something)
//       - Or maybe just not worrying about it is possible if it turns out, that even non-vectorized code can reach the memory bandwidth limits we are constrained by
