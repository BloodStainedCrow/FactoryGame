# What is this?
This project is an academic recreation of the factory game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) taking additional ideas from [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/).

I created it as an exercise to see how far I could optimize the basic concepts and algorithms of the genre in terms of performance, while allowing myself  minor changes to the games' rules.
Another goal that emerged along the way, was learning about the way modern CPUs actually work.

# Roadmap
Currently I am working on designing the power system. The next step after that, is to create the tile based world representation and allow proper building of factories.

# Why did you start?
I was playing the above games and started being unable to expand due to performance issues. So in my hubris I declared: "How hard can it be?".
